Task 1
Write a number of BDD scenarios using Gherkin to test the following features:

Adding things to, and removing things from, the bet slip
Changing the odds format

Task 2
Create a simple test framework using NPM, Cypress and Cucumber to automate a selection of the scenarios you have created. You should include at least two scenarios from each feature.
